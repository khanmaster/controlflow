age = 16
# if the user is above the age of 15 allow them to buy a ticket
if age == 15: # if this condition is met/true the print statement will execute
    print("Thank you, please proceed to you purchase ")

# if the user is under 15 years of age do not allow to buy a ticket
elif age < 15:
    print("Sorry you are under age to watch this movie ")
